Java FX Demos

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield

A number of Java FX Demo projects for use by students.

Currently there is:

	a classic HelloWorld created without an fxml file,
	a set of pop-up window demos of varying complexity (created without fxml files),
	a HelloWorld created with scene builder and xfml,
	a CountingButton created with scene builder and xfml,
	a (pretty poor) Calculator created with scene builder and xfml,
	a Collections demo using the ListView and ObservableList classes, created with scene builder and xfml.
	a Table and Pie Chart demo heavily based upon one found online at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23964885/binding-chart-to-tableview-javafx

These may all be updated over time, and other demos may be added.
