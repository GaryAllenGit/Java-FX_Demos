Java FX Demos

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield

A number of Java FX Demo projects for use by students.

Currently there is:
	a classic HelloWorld,
	a CountingButton,
	a (pretty poor) Calculator,
	a Collections demo using the ListView and ObservableList classes.

These may all be updated over time, and other demos may be added.
